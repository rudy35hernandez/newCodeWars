Return the number of unique arrays that can be formed by picking exactly one element from each subarray.

For example: solve([[1,2],[4],[5,6]]) = 4, because it results in only 4 possibilites. They are [1,4,5],
[1,4,6],[2,4,5],[2,4,6].

Make sure that you don't count duplicates; for example solve([[1,2],[4,4],[5,6,6]]) = 4, since the extra 
outcomes are just duplicates.

You will be given an array of numbers in which two numbers occur once and the rest occur only twice. Your task 
will be to return the sum of the numbers that occur only once.

other number occurs twice.

  The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string 
  is "(" if that character appears only once in the original string, or ")" if that character appears more than 
  once in the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.

Examples
"din"      =>  "((("
"recede"   =>  "()()()"
"Success"  =>  ")())())"
"(( @"     =>  "))(("

Assertion messages may be unclear about what they display in some languages. If you read "...It Should

In this Kata, you will be given an array of unique elements, and your task is to rearrange the values so that the 
first max value is followed by the first minimum, followed by second max value then second min value, etc.

For example:

solve([15,11,10,7,12]) = [15,7,12,10,11]
The first max is 15 and the first min is 7. The second max is 12 and the second min is 10 and so on.
