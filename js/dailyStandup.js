Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.

For example, for [1, 2, 2] it should return 9 because 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 9.

    return numbers.map(num=> num ** 2).reduce((sum, num)=> sum + num)

Return the number of unique arrays that can be formed by picking exactly one element from each subarray.

For example: solve([[1,2],[4],[5,6]]) = 4, because it results in only 4 possibilites. They are [1,4,5],
[1,4,6],[2,4,5],[2,4,6].

Make sure that you don't count duplicates; for example solve([[1,2],[4,4],[5,6,6]]) = 4, since the extra 
outcomes are just duplicates.

Test.assertEquals(solve([[1,2],[4],[5,6]]),4);
Test.assertEquals(solve([[1,2],[4,4],[5,6,6]]),4);
Test.assertEquals(solve([[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]),8);
Test.assertEquals(solve([[1,2,3],[3,4,6,6,7],[8,9,10,12,5,6]]),72);




Create a function that takes in a string that will contain a mix of upper case and lower case letter. If
the string contains more upperCase letter than lowerCase, return the string in all upperCase. Same rule applies 
if there are more lowerCase letters. If there are an equal ammount of lowerCase and upperCase letters, return
the string in lowerCase letter.

*/

function lowerVsUpper(str){
    let upper = str.split('').filter(letter => letter === letter.toUpperCase())
    return str.length / 2 >= upper.length ? str.toLowerCase() : str.toUpperCase()
  }

You will be given an array of numbers in which two numbers occur once and the rest occur only twice. Your task 
will be to return the sum of the numbers that occur only once.

For example, repeats([4,5,7,5,4,8]) = 15 because only the numbers 7 and 8 occur once, and their sum is 15. Every 
other number occurs twice.

Test.assertEquals(repeats([4,5,7,5,4,8]),15);
Test.assertEquals(repeats([9, 10, 19, 13, 19, 13]),19);
Test.assertEquals(repeats([16, 0, 11, 4, 8, 16, 0, 11]),12);
Test.assertEquals(repeats([5, 17, 18, 11, 13, 18, 11, 13]),22);
Test.assertEquals(repeats([5, 10, 19, 13, 10, 13]),24);
