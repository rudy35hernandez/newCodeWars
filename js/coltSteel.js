                    // TIME COMPLEXITY //

/// Problem with time complexity, not reliable because you will most likely get different times with different
/// machines. Even the same machine will record different times.
/// For fast algo's, speed measurements may not be precise enough


                                //// BIG O SHORTHANDS ///

// 1. Arithmic operations are constant
// 2. Assignments are constant
// 3. Accessing elements in an Array (by index) or object (by key) is constant. Ex. arr[3]
// 4. In a loop, the complexity is the length of the loop times complexity of whatever happens inside the loop

/// Time Complexity (time it takes)




/// Space Complexity (the amount of memory taken up)

// Most primitives (booleans, numbers, undefined, null) are constant space
// Strings require O(n) space (where n is the string length)
// Reference types are generally O(n), where n is the length (for arrays), or the number of keys (for objects)
